This project is an example of a booking website, in which hotels can contact the tourism agency, which manages the hotels by adding, editing, or even removing them. In addition, hotels can contact the agency through the contact page. Or even customers can send their questions to each hotel.

## Description

- Home page (index.js)
- Hotel page (add_hotel.js)
- Details page ([id].js) (Dynamically generated)
- Contact page (contact.js)
- Login page (login.js)
- Admin page (admin.js)

## Admin information

User: admin@holidaze.com
Password: Admin1234

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
